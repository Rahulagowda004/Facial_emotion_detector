# üòä **Facial Emotion Detection Web Application**  

A web-based application that detects human emotions from images using advanced deep-learning techniques. This project uses state-of-the-art libraries and frameworks to build, train, and deploy facial emotion detection models, ensuring high accuracy and scalability.  

---

### üß† **Model Architecture**  

The **Facial Emotion Detection Model** is built using **DenseNet201** as the base layers, followed by custom convolutional, dropout, and dense layers for feature extraction and classification. Below is the detailed architecture:  

#### **Base Layers**  
- **DenseNet201**: Used as the base model for feature extraction, pretrained on ImageNet.

#### **Custom Layers**  

```python
# First Convolutional Block
x = tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), padding='same')(model.output)  
x = tf.keras.layers.Dropout(0.45)(x)  
x = tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(16, (3, 3), padding='same')(x)  
x = tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2), padding='same')(x)  

# Second Convolutional Block
x = tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(32, (3, 3), padding='same')(x)  
x = tf.keras.layers.Dropout(0.45)(x)  
x = tf.keras.layers.Conv2D(16, (3, 3), padding='same')(x)  
x = tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling2D((2, 2), padding='same')(x)  

# Fully Connected Layers
flatten_in = tf.keras.layers.Flatten()(x)  
x = tf.keras.layers.Dense(1024, activation='relu')(flatten_in)  
x = tf.keras.layers.Dense(512, activation='relu')(x)  
x = tf.keras.layers.Dropout(0.25)(x)  
x = tf.keras.layers.Dense(216, activation='relu')(x)  

# Output Layer
prediction = tf.keras.layers.Dense(
    units=classes,  
    activation='softmax'  
)(x)  
```

### **Highlights of the Architecture**  
1. **Base Model**: DenseNet201 efficiently extracts spatial features from input images.  
2. **Convolutional Layers**: Added convolutional layers with dropout for feature refinement and reduction of overfitting.  
3. **Pooling**: MaxPooling layers for spatial dimensionality reduction.  
4. **Fully Connected Layers**: Dense layers for high-level feature interpretation, leading to the classification output.  
5. **Output Layer**: Final softmax layer to predict the probability distribution across emotion classes.  

This layered design ensures that the model is both robust and capable of handling complex patterns in the data.
